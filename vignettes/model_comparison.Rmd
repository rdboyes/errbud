Here's a simple dplyr chain that causes an error: 

```R
tibble(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -6)) |> 
  mutate(y = 26 + x^2, z = y - 15) |> 
  select(-y) |> 
  mutate(a = 15 * y)
```

The following sections are the unedited results of calling `errbud::ai()` with a selection of local LLMs. If you want a summary : 

**Effectiveness of the proposed fixes (according to `gpt-oss`)**

| # | Solution ID | What the answer proposes | Correctness | Overall Effectiveness (1‑5) |
|---|-------------|--------------------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------------------|
| 1 | qwen2.5‑coder 0.5b | Loads dozens of packages, rewrites the whole pipeline, keeps the `y` column after `select(-y)` | ❌ No – `y` is still dropped before `a = 15
* y` is evaluated. | 1 |
| 2 | qwen2.5‑coder 1.5b | Suggests “manually assigning” `y` then computing `a` in a separate `mutate` | ❌ No – the code is syntactically wrong and still refers to `y` after it has been dropped. | 1 |
| 3 | qwen2.5‑coder 3b | `library(tidyverse)` → create tibble → `mutate(y, z)` → `a = 15 * y` (no drop) | ✅ Yes – fully functional and self‑contained. | 4 |
| 4 | qwen2.5‑coder 7b | Creates `data` with `y` and `z`, then separately `mutate(a = 15 * y)` | ✅ Yes – works, keeps `y` available. | 3 |
| 5 | qwen2.5‑coder 14b | Single chain: `mutate(y, z, a)` (no drop) | ✅ Yes – concise, correct. | 5 |
| 6 | qwen2.5‑coder 32b | Chain: `mutate(y)`, `mutate(-y)`, `mutate(a)` | ❌ No – `mutate(-y)` is meaningless; it creates a new column named “-y” and still drops `y` before `a` is computed. | 1 |
| 7 | gpt‑oss | `mutate(y, z, a)` → `select(-y)` (drop after `a` is computed) | ✅ Yes – exactly fixes the original problem while keeping `y` until it’s no longer needed. | 5 |   

Overall - Use `gpt-oss` if your hardware can support it, otherwise use the biggest you can of `qwen2.5-coder:3b`, `qwen2.5-coder:7b`, and `qwen2.5-coder:14b`. `qwen2.5-coder:32b` is actually bigger than `gpt-oss` and is much worse - I would not recommend using it.  `qwen2.5-coder:0.5b` and `qwen2.5-coder:1.5b` are fine for testing, but are unlikely to help you solve any non-trivial errors. 

### `qwen2.5-coder:0.5b`

The issue you're encountering is due to how `dplyr` manages objects in its package hierarchy. When you run the code, some objects are missing from the current working directory (cwd) or are being reloaded based on their dependencies.

In your case, the error message indicates that `y` is not found in the `data` frame (`x`), which is then used as a condition within the `mutate` function when `a = 15 * y`. To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that `y` is present in the environment where your code is running.

Here's how you can update your package environments and ensure you have all necessary objects available:

```r
# Load your packages
install.packages(c("base", "dplyr", "gorilla", "stringr"))
library(base, quietly = TRUE)
library(dplyr, quietly = TRUE)
library(gorilla, quietly = TRUE)
library(stringr, quietly = TRUE)

# Update package environments across all loaded libraries
update.packages(all.packages, repos = c("https://cran.r-project.org/pkgs/"), quietly = TRUE)

# Run your code again
mutate(select(mutate(tibble(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -6)), y = 26 + x^2, z = y - 15), a = 15 * y))
```

This will ensure that all the required packages are loaded properly and that `y` is available from the current working directory. If you still encounter issues or need further assistance, please provide more details about your environment and package versions, and I'll be happy to assist you better.
  
Remember, updating package environments and ensuring all objects are present can speed up your R programming life, especially if you have large datasets or complex analyses.

### `qwen2.5-coder:1.5b`

The error message is occurring because R was unable to find the variable `y` in the environment where the mutate operation was performed. This could be due to either: 

- The `y` variable not being passed as an argument to the mutate function or a typo in the column name within the mutate function.
  
- The mutation code might be trying to manipulate `x` before accessing `y`, resulting in an attempt to access `y` when the value of `y` hasn't been assigned yet.

To fix this issue, you can manually assign the value of `y` before performing the mutate operation. Replace the error-prone line with:

```r
y = 26 + x^2
mutate(tibble(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -6)), y = y, z = y - 15)
a = 15 * y
```

This way, R can find the value of `y` before processing it in the mutate operation.

### `qwen2.5-coder:3b`

The error you're encountering is likely due to an issue within the `tidyverse` family of packages as they integrate various functionalities into a unified workflow. The code snippet you provided involves several data manipulation operations using `dplyr`, which can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior if not properly managed within your environment.

To resolve this issue, ensure that all required packages are loaded and that your dataset is correctly defined at the time of operation. Here's how you can modify your code:

```r
# Ensure all necessary packages are loaded
library(tidyverse)

# Define a tidy data frame with column x
x_df <- tibble(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -6))

# Mutate the data frame to include y and z columns
x_df <- x_df %>%
  mutate(y = 26 + x^2) %>%
  mutate(z = y - 15)

# Compute column 'a' as 15 times y
x_df$a <- 15 * x_df$y

# Print the resulting data frame to verify changes
print(x_df)
```

This approach should resolve the error you're encountering and allow you to manipulate your dataset effectively within your R environment.

### `qwen2.5-coder:7b`

The error you're encountering is due to the `y` column being created after you attempt to use it in the `mutate(a = 15 * y)` step. To fix this, ensure that all columns used in subsequent operations are defined before they are referenced.

Here's how you can adjust your code:

```r
data <- mutate(
  tibble(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -6)), 
  y = 26 + x^2,
  z = y - 15
)
result <- mutate(data, a = 15 * y)
```

By separating the creation of `data` and `result`, you ensure that `y` is available when you attempt to use it in the second `mutate(a = 15 * y)` call.

If this doesn't resolve your issue or if you need further assistance, feel free to ask.

### `qwen2.5-coder:14b`

The error message indicates that the object `y` is not found in the environment when `mutate()` tries to compute the 
expression `15 * y`. This suggests that the definition of `y` is incomplete or might have been omitted in your code 
snippet.

To fix this issue, ensure that you define `tibble(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -6))` correctly. The second argument to 
`mutate()` should include a complete expression for `y`. Based on the information provided, it seems like `y` was 
intended to be defined as `26 + x^2`.

Here's how you can correct your code:

```r
library(dplyr)

# Create the tibble and define y correctly
tibble(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -6)) %>%
  mutate(y = 26 + x^2) %>%  # Ensure y is defined here
  mutate(z = y - 15, a = 15 * y)
```

This should resolve the error as it ensures that `y` is properly defined before you try to use it in subsequent 
computations. Make sure to run this snippet step-by-step in your R environment to verify that everything works as 
expected.

### `qwen2.5-coder:32b`

The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `y` is being used in a `mutate()` context where it hasn't been defined yet in the current pipeline. In `dplyr`, when mutating columns, each new column is not immediately available for use in subsequent operations within the same `mutate()` call unless you chain them properly.

To fix this, you can break the `mutate()` calls into separate steps so that `y` is defined before it's used to calculate `a`. Here's how you can do it:

```r
library(dplyr)
tibble(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -6)) %>%
    mutate(y = 26 + x^2) %>%
    mutate(-y) %>% 
    mutate(a = 15 * y)
```

This code first calculates `y`, then negates it (though the `-y` step doesn't seem to be affecting `a`, so you might want to remove or adjust it if not needed), and finally calculates `a` using the defined `y`. If the negation of `y` is intended for use in another part of your analysis, ensure that it fits logically within your data transformations.

### `gpt-oss`: Success

`mutate()` evaluates its expressions in the order they are written and inside a single call all the new columns are available to the subsequent ones. In your code you nest two calls:

```r
mutate(                                       # outer mutate
  select(                                     # inner SELECT
    mutate(tibble(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -6)),  # create y and z
           y = 26 + x^2,
           z = y - 15),
    -y                                        # drop y
  ),
  a = 15 * y                                  # outer mutate tries to use y
)
```

The `select( … , -y)` removes the column **y** before the outer `mutate()` tries to reference it, so R cannot find `y` and throws the error.  

**Fix:** create `a` before you drop `y`, or keep `y` in the data frame until after you are done using it. A concise way is:

```r
library(dplyr)

tibble(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -6)) %>%
  mutate(
    y = 26 + x^2,
    z = y - 15,
    a = 15 * y
  ) %>%
  select(-y)          # drop y only after a is computed
```

This keeps `y` available for the calculation of `a`, then removes it once it is no longer needed.
